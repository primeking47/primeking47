# 👋 Hi there, I'm Primeking47, Interested in the intersection of Water Engineering and AI/ML.

Leveraging a decade of hands-on experience in water infrastructure design and construction, I'm currently augmenting my skill set with a Master's in Engineering (Data Science). I'm on a mission to innovate water management by fusing traditional engineering practices with data science and machine learning.
